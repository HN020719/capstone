# Genetic Risk Prediction using cis-eQTL Analysis and PRS

## Project Overview
This project performs a cis-eQTL analysis using 1000 Genomes data to develop polygenic risk scores (PRS) for predicting gene expression and disease risk. The study evaluates different p-value and \(R^2\) thresholds to optimize model performance, with the goal of understanding genetic liability for gene expression and its potential application in disease prediction.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
   - merge_data
- **External Data Files** (must be downloaded separately):
  - [GD462.GeneQuantRPKM.50FN.samplename.resk10.txt](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CaE4rGz7yP0LPaS6Kv_SoBgdc1I99EWL?usp=drive_link): Gene expression data used for training and validation.
  - [all_cis_eQTL_results.csv](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CaE4rGz7yP0LPaS6Kv_SoBgdc1I99EWL?usp=drive_link): Results from the cis-eQTL analysis, including associations between SNPs and gene expression.
  - [Height GWAS Summary Statistics]([https://example-link-to-height-gwas.com](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CaE4rGz7yP0LPaS6Kv_SoBgdc1I99EWL?usp=drive_link)): Dataset containing summary statistics for height, including SNPs, odds ratios (OR), and p-values, required for PRS calculation.
  - [Genetics of Personality Consortium (GPC) GWAS Data](https://tweelingenregister.vu.nl/gpc#): Summary statistics for personality traits such as extraversion and openness.

- `notebooks/`:  Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and final predictive modeling workflows.
   - Includes step-by-step documentation of cis-eQTL identification, PRS calculation, and trait-based analyses.
- `requirements.txt`: Required packages for running the code.
- `output/`: Sample outputs generated by the scripts.
- `plink/`: Directory containing PLINK software and configuration files for genotype processing.

## Getting Started
Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PLINK 1.9 installed and configured ([can be downloaded from here](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/).
- Clone this repository.
- Install required packages:
   ```bash
