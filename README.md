# Genetic Risk Prediction using cis-eQTL Analysis and PRS

## Project Overview
This project performs a cis-eQTL analysis using 1000 Genomes data to develop polygenic risk scores (PRS) for predicting gene expression and disease risk. The study evaluates different p-value and \(R^2\) thresholds to optimize model performance, with the goal of understanding genetic liability for gene expression and its potential application in disease prediction.
